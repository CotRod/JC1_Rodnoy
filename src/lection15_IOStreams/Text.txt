Closing a stream when it's no longer needed is very important - so important
that CopyBytes uses a finally block to guarantee that both streams will be closed even if an error occurs.
This practice helps avoid serious resource leaks.

One possible error is that CopyBytes was unable to open one or both files.
When that happens, the stream variable corresponding to the file never changes from its initial null value.
That's why CopyBytes makes sure that each stream variable contains an object reference before invoking close.
